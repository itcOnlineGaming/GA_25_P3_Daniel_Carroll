## Overview

The **Simple 2D World Builder** package is designed to help developers rapidly create and edit 2D game worlds within Unity. It features an intuitive grid system, automatic tile scaling, a painting/erasing tool with adjustable brush sizes, and a custom editor window for quick actions. This component package is perfect for prototyping levels, building static game environments, or even creating fully dynamic worlds.

## Features

- **Grid System:** 
  - Configurable grid dimensions (grid width and height) and cell size.
  - Visual grid overlay in the Scene view using Gizmos.

- **Tile Placement:**
  - Place tiles by clicking on the grid.
  - Auto-adjust tile sprite scale to fill the grid cell.
  - Right-click erase functionality.
  - Option to replace existing tiles by placing a new tile on an occupied cell.

- **Brush Tools:**
  - Adjustable brush radius to "paint" larger areas with a single drag.
  - Supports both painting and erasing multiple tiles at once.

- **Editor Enhancements:**
  - Custom Editor Window with a tile palette preview, quick action buttons (clear all, recalc, repaint).
  - Brush settings (slider to control brush radius).
  - Built-in support for Undo/Redo using UnityEditor utilities.

- **Persistence and Saving:**
  - Tiles are saved as part of the scene.
  - On scene load, the package automatically rebuilds its internal dictionary so that all placed tiles become erasable and adjustable.

## Installation

1. **Download and Import the Package:**
   - Download the Simple 2D World Builder package.
   - In Unity, go to **Assets > Import Package > Custom Package...** and select the downloaded package.
   - Make sure all scripts and editor folders are imported into your project.

2. **Folder Structure:**
   - **Scripts Folder:** Contains runtime scripts such as `Simple2DWorldBuilder.cs` and `Tile2D.cs`.
   - **Editor Folder:** Contains editor scripts such as `Simple2DWorldBuilderEditor.cs` and `WorldBuilderWindow.cs`.

## Setup & Configuration

1. **Add the World Builder Component:**
   - In your scene, create an empty GameObject (e.g., named `WorldBuilder`).
   - Attach the `Simple2DWorldBuilder` component to the GameObject.

2. **Configure Grid Settings:**
   - Set your desired **grid width**, **grid height**, and **cell size** in the Inspector.
   - Adjust the **brush radius** (0 for single cell, 1 for a 3Ã—3 block, etc.) as needed.

3. **Tile Placement Setup:**
   - Populate the **tilePrefabs** array with your tile prefabs.
   - (Optional) Create a dedicated GameObject (e.g., named `Tiles`) to serve as the parent for all placed tiles and assign it to the **tilesParent** field.

## Using the Scene Tools

### Placing and Erasing Tiles

- **Left-click** (or drag) on the grid in the Scene view to place tiles.
  - The system calculates the cell based on your click position.
  - If a tile already exists in that cell, it is replaced with the new tile.
  
- **Right-click** (or drag) on the grid to erase tiles.
  - Tiles are removed from both the scene and the internal dictionary.

### Brush Support

- When holding down the mouse button, the tool will paint or erase all cells within the current brush radius.
- The brush radius can be adjusted via the custom editor window (see next section).

## Using the Custom Editor Window

1. **Open the World Builder Window:**
   - Navigate to **Tools > World Builder Window** in the Unity menu.

2. **Assign the Active Builder:**
   - In the window, drag your `WorldBuilder` GameObject into the "Builder Object" field.
   - This connects the window to your active world builder.

3. **Tile Palette:**
   - View a scrollable tile palette showing thumbnails of your available tile prefabs.
   - Click **"Select"** on a tile to set it as the active tile for placement.

4. **Brush Settings:**
   - Adjust the **Brush Radius** slider to change how many cells are painted/erased at once.

5. **Quick Actions:**
   - **Clear All Tiles:** Removes every placed tile, and also clears all children under the designated `tilesParent`.
   - **Recalculate Tiles:** Repositions and resizes all placed tiles to match any changes to the grid settings.
   - **Repaint Scene View:** Forces an update of the Scene view to reflect recent changes.

## Saving and Reloading Levels

- **Scene Persistence:**
  - All placed tile GameObjects are saved as part of the scene.
  - The `Tile2D` component attached to each tile stores its grid coordinate, and these values are serialized.
  
- **Automatic Dictionary Rebuild:**
  - When the scene is reloaded (or Unity is reopened), the `OnEnable()` method in `Simple2DWorldBuilder` scans the `tilesParent` for any child with a `Tile2D` component.
  - The internal `placedTiles` dictionary is rebuilt so that all previously placed tiles can be managed (e.g., erased or recalculated).

- **Usage Note:**
  - If you experience issues with tiles not being erasable upon scene reload, use the **Clear All Tiles** button in the World Builder Window to refresh the state. The rebuilt dictionary ensures future modifications work as expected.

## Best Practices & Tips

- **Consistent Sprite Settings:**
  - Ensure your tile prefabs have proper sprite import settings (e.g., correct Pixels Per Unit) so that auto-scaling works as expected.
  
- **Organize Hierarchy:**
  - Use a dedicated `tilesParent` GameObject to keep the scene hierarchy tidy. This is especially useful for large levels.

- **Undo Support:**
  - Leverage the Editor's Undo/Redo functionality. Use the provided editor scripts to support Undo for tile placement and removal.

- **Testing:**
  - Regularly test changes in both Edit Mode and Play Mode to ensure consistency in tile behavior.

## Known Issues & Troubleshooting

- **Tile Persistence Issues:**
  - If tiles placed before saving are not erasable upon reloading the scene, verify that the `OnEnable()` method is correctly rebuilding the dictionary from the children of `tilesParent`.
  - Use the **Clear All Tiles** button to force a cleanup if needed.

- **Editor-Only API:**
  - The package uses Editor-only classes (e.g., `PrefabUtility`, `Undo`). Ensure your code is properly wrapped with `#if UNITY_EDITOR` to avoid build issues.
